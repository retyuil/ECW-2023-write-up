# Babel

In the message.png we see a grid with different alphabet used, I firstly recognize the braille alphabet and the deadric alphabet. 

I found this page : https://www.dcode.fr/symbols-ciphers

And the alphabet used in the image is in this website.

After decoding the image we get the following message : 

congratulations to obtain the flag grab all the bytes in the seventh column from the file unknown.txt and sha one these.
